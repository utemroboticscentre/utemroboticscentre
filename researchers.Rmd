Shariman Abdullah is currently serving as a lecturer at the Fakulti Kejuruteraan Pembuatan in Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, Malaysia since 2002. He graduated with bachelors in mechanical engineering from Tokushima University, Japan in 1999. He then obtains his masters degree in Mechatronic at Loughborough University in 2003 and completed his PhD from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia in 2017. His research area is mainly related with control system of mobile manipulator. A mobile manipulator is a combination of a mobile platform and an arm or manipulator mounted onto it. The control system for the mobile manipulator require precise and high level of torque control system therefore a torque control technique identified as Active Force Control was implemented. The mobile manipulator was design and fabricated based on mechatronics approach using various type of microcontroller, actuators and sensors. His research also involves virtual system design using a technique commonly known as co-simulation. The co-simulation technique allows researchers to design, test and built a virtual mechatronics system in a virtual physical environment which help to cut design mistake, shorten development time and allow easier test and analysis being performed
